  Mercury:

    mass: 0.055
    radius: 0.3825

    description: "Of the eight planets in our Solar System, Mercury is the first planet from the Sun. It orbits the Sun once every 88 Earth days, completing three rotations about its axis for every two orbits. Mercury is also the smallest planet in our Solar System. Like Earth, it is a rocky, terrestrial planet. Composed roughly of 70% metal and 30% silicate materials, Mercury has the highest iron content of any other planet in our Solar System. Mercury's iron core accounts for almost half of its volume."

  Venus:

    mass: 0.815

    description:"In our Solar System, Venus is the second planet from the Sun, orbiting it every 225 Earth days. Of all the planets in our Solar System, Venus's size and mass are comparable to Earth, suggesting that its internal composition and structure are similar. Like Earth, it is a rocky planet. However, unlike Earth there is no evidence for plate tectonics on Venus. Instead, Venus may release its internal heat in bursts of volcanic activity that almost completely resurface the planet."

  Earth:

    description: "Earth is the third planet from the Sun. It orbits the Sun every 365 days, completing a rotation every 24 hours. Earth formed approximately 4.5 billion years ago when large fragments of dust and debris clumped together, ultimately forming our terrestrial planet. Today, the interior of Earth can be divided into distinct layers with a hard outer crust and outer mantle, a highly viscous inner mantle, liquid outer core and a solid inner core."

  Mars:

    mass:  0.107
    radius: 0.3825
    volume: 0.151

    distance: 1.52
    moons: 2
    description: "Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun in our Solar System. Mars's rotation and tilt are similar to Earth's. Mars is a terrestrial or rocky planet having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the volcanoes, valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth. Mars is the site of Olympus Mons, the highest known mountain in the Solar System, and of Valles Marineris, the largest canyon. The smooth Borealis basin in the northern hemisphere covers 40% of the planet and may be a giant impact feature."

  Jupiter:

    mass: 318
    radius: 11.209
    volume: 1321
    distance: "484,000,000"
    distance_au: 5.20
    moons: 66
    description: "Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest planet within our Solar System. It is a gas giant with mass one-thousandth that of the Sun but is two and a half times the mass of all the other planets in our Solar System combined. Jupiter is classified as a gas giant along with Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Together, these four planets are sometimes referred to as the Jovian or outer planets."

  Saturn:

    mass: 95.2 
    radius: 9.449
    volume: 764
    distance: "885,000,000"
    distance_au: 9.54
    moons: 200
    description: "Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun. Made mostly of hydrogen and helium, Saturn is the second largest planet in our Solar System, after Jupiter. Saturn is a gas giant with an average radius about nine times that of Earth. Scientists believe Saturn has a rocky core at least 9 times as massive as the Earth. Despite its great size, Saturn has the lowest density of any planet, about 30% less dense than water."

  Uranus:
    name: "Uranus"

    mass: 14.5
    radius: 4.007
    volume: 63.1
    distance:  "1,790,000,000"
    distance_au: 19.19
    moons: 27
    description:"Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun. It has the third-largest planetary radius and fourth-largest planetary mass in our Solar System. Like Neptune, the majority of Uranus's mass is contained in an extended liquid mantle consisting mostly of water, methane and ammonia that originally came from icy materials in the outer Solar System. For this reason, Uranus and Neptune are sometimes called “ice giants.”"

  Neptune:

    mass: 17.1 
    radius: 3.883
    volume: 57.7
    distance: "2,800,000,000"
    distance_au: 30.06 
    moons: 12
    description: "Neptune is the eighth and farthest planet from the Sun in our Solar System. Neptune is 17 times the mass of Earth and is slightly more massive than its near-twin Uranus. Like Uranus, Neptune's internal composition is similar to its twin, with most of its mass present in a hot, fluid mantle made of water, ammonia and methane. The high heat and pressure in the mantle may decompose methane and compress it into tiny diamonds, which then rain down into the core of the planet."
